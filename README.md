# About

I have created this repo to do deep dive into usecases of Tailwind for styling and micro interactions. Might add Framer Motion later to create super slick UX.

## How to use

Execute `yarn` then `yarn dev` using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), example:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
